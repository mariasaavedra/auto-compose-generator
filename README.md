# auto-compose-generator
An auto compose generator that comes as shortened link. 

Run `npm install && node index.js` to get the application running.

The application runs at `localhost:3000`

Right now the DB connection is exposed publicly in the repo (no good), so please update this with an untracked .ENV file.

I'm using Atlas Cloud for a free mongo database repo, see connection string on line `16` on `index.js`

To run this online you'll want to dockerize this. 

If you have any questions at all, please email me at msaav3@gmail.com
